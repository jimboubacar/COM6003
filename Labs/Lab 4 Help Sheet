Lab 4: Enhanced Comprehensive Security

CONTEXT
The final lab focuses on implementing enterprise-grade security to protect patient data both in transit and at rest. 
You will apply encryption, strengthen defences against injection attacks, secure application assets, and conduct 
full security testing to ensure compliance with healthcare standards.

AIMS & OBJECTIVES
	To implement end-to-end encryption for all sensitive data.
	To prevent injection and related security attacks through input sanitisation.
	To secure application assets against reverse engineering and tampering.
	To perform comprehensive security testing and produce supporting documentation.
	To ensure compliance with healthcare data protection and privacy regulations.

USER REQUIREMENTS
Functional Requirements
	All communication must be encrypted using TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning.
	The Room database must use full SQLCipher encryption.
	Input sanitisation must be applied to prevent SQL injection and related vulnerabilities.
	Application assets and configurations must be encrypted and obfuscated.
	Runtime protection must include root or emulator detection and application signature validation.
	Dynamic security policies must be enforced at runtime.
	Field-level encryption must be applied to all PHI.
	A security test suite must validate encryption, injection protection, and runtime integrity.

Non-Functional Requirements
	ProGuard or R8 must be used for code and asset hardening.
	No sensitive data or logs should appear in production environments.
	The application must use a network security configuration with certificate pinning.
	The system must demonstrate compliance with recognised healthcare security standards.
