Lab 3: Clinical Records & Advanced Features

CONTEXT
This lab introduces the Electronic Health Record (EHR) component, which expands the systemâ€™s capabilities to manage clinical information. 
You will develop patient summaries, enable recording of vital signs, and implement barcode-based patient identification. 
This stage also introduces offline data management and accessibility enhancements.

AIMS & OBJECTIVES
	To design and implement an EHR system for storing and displaying patient data.
	To enable barcode scanning for accurate and efficient patient identification.
	To incorporate offline capabilities using background processing tools.
	To enhance system performance and accessibility for all users.

USER REQUIREMENTS
Functional Requirements
	The system must provide a patient summary interface displaying information such as conditions, allergies, and medications.
	The system must allow healthcare professionals to record and submit patient vital signs.
	The application must include barcode scanning functionality for patient matching via wristbands.
	Offline queueing must be implemented to ensure that data collected without connectivity is synchronised once online.

Non-Functional Requirements
	The system must use pagination to maintain performance with large datasets.
	Accessibility features, including TalkBack support, must be implemented for visually impaired users.
	Offline synchronisation must be reliable, using background tasks for data transmission.
	No Protected Health Information (PHI) should appear in system logs or notifications.

DELIVERABLES
	Operational clinical records management system.
	Barcode scanning and patient matching capability.
	Offline data handling through background synchronisation.
	Accessibility enhancements to meet healthcare usability standards.
